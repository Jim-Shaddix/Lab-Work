# File Descriptions #
1. `main.m`: This is the main project file. This file calls all of the 
           functions I have developed, in order to visualize and track peaks.
2. `Make_Plots`: This file contains a function, that takes in a number of 
                 different arguemnts, in order to plot the data




# Peak Analyses #

## Parameters Used by Lab Actor: Line Detector ##
* Initial Fit Guess:
    - _Peak Finder_
    - Last Fit: use
* Fit Window
    - Ex: each peak fit is 10kh
    - _1kHz_
* Relative thresold
    - percent of the max peak whose height has been specified??
    - _0.2_
