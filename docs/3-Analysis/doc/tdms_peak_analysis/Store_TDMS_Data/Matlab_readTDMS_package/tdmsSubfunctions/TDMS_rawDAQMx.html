0003 TDMS files can store many different types of data inside of them, such as 
0004 uint8, int16, doubles, etc. A full list is outside the scope of this document.
0005 
0006 One of these data types is rawDAQmx. I think this data type is actually the
0007 bit representation captured by the DAQ (hence the name raw). The presence
0008 of this data type in the meta <span class="keyword">for</span> a TDMS file refers to the fact that the
0009 data has a true IEEE like data type underneath, as well as properties that
0010 are stored with the file that inform the user how to scale the data from
0011 the the bit-level representation to a true number.
0012 
0013 The primary reason one might use this format is because it gets rid of the
0014 intermediate step of converting the data to a known data type before
0015 saving. This could be advantageous because it could save computational
0016 time and memory from not doing the conversion, as well as time and disk space
0017 from writing a smaller file to disk.
0018 
0019 This data type however is not an open specification. In the TDMS file the
0020 header before the data will specify that upcoming data has this data type,
0021 allowing one to skip over that data section.
0022 
0023 I have contacted the NI about this and received the following response:
0024 <span class="comment">%==========================================================================</span>
0025 I apologize but since most of the TDMS format  is a National Instrument
0026 proprietary file structure I can really only help you out with any of the
0027 information that is already provided.  I have included a link to a
0028 KnowledgeBase below that walks through TDMS in a lot more detail.  Please
0029 have a look through and hopefully it will answer some of your questions.

0034 
0035 That being said I have been able to obtain the data from this format in
0036 some example files that I created. However, since these example files are
0037 relatively few, and since I have no idea how to generalize my code, I have
0038 not formally included support <span class="keyword">for</span> this data type. If I get some more
0039 example files with rawDAQmx data I would likely include a mode in which one
0040 could attempt to retrieve data from this data type.
0041 
0042 Finally, National Instruments does provide some old drivers. I think they
0043 only work <span class="keyword">for</span> 32 bit Windows but they may support the rawDAQmx data type
