### Vocabulary ###
1. [Red Pitaya](https://www.redpitaya.com/index2):
2. [transducers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer): Things that convert
   one form of energy, into another form of energy.
3. amplifier board

1.) A **red pitaya** is used to interface 
with an **amplifier board**, that is connected to a couple **transducers**.
The Red Pitaya interprets all of the info that we use to make plots.

2.) The transducers in this system contain crystals, that make use of the 
[piezoelectric-effect](http://www.nanomotion.com/piezo-ceramic-motor-technology/piezoelectric-effect/).
The **piezo-effect** is a reversible process in which certain materials generate
an electric charge, in response to some mechanical stress. In the case of our
system, we placed our sample inbetween two transducers, and we generated an 
electric signal from the red pitaya, that than went through the amplifier, 
and that

They are made of piezo electric crystals.

3.) Measurements of the system are taken inside of a [ppms (physical property
measurement system)](https://www.qdusa.com/products/ppms.html).

## Software ##
1.) **lab actor program:** Is used to interface with the **red patia**.

2.) **Comms Client program:** interfaces with lab actor remotely, and it allows
you to perform batch runs.

3.) **Andrews Program:** Interfaces with the ppms to set temperature, and 
magnetic field values. Uses the **dynacool software** to interface with the 
ppms with **multiview**? His program also interfaces with the comms client.
