# Goals: #
1. rename all the csv   files.
    - ls | grep '\.csv$' 
2. rename all the excel files. (not necessarily needed)
3. create plots of all of the files
4. create clickable plot of all the files, 
    (that records the markers you create)
5. create a plot of all of the markers that were clicked

- create a vim-script for renaming files, save it in the bashrc 
- look into search-and- replace, and how to use visual-block
