# NOTE #
* for tracking peaks I should look into:
    - unsupervised learning with suport vector machines (support-vector clustering)

# Fixes To Make: #
1. I need to work with the data collection computer, I need to see if I can 
   defragment files.
2. I can also try fix-up the matlab program:
    1. write it more modular:
        - (1) first window: 
            - allows you to use find peaks, and fit them.
        - (2) second window:
            - allows you to pick a method for tracking peaks.
3. practice basic matlab data structures.
